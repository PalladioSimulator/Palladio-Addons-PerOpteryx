The TaskList is the root model element and contains a Task and Probabilities model. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The main class is the Task. It represents a single resource-demanding action in the software. It is derived from actions in the PCM SEFF and can be used for tasks in the optimisation of Polimi. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Tasks are connected to each other by Edges. Each Task can have multiple outgoing Edges. The set of outgoing Edges is modelled with the edge_Task containment association of the Task. Each Edge points to one successor Task. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;See the description of the model elements for a detailed description of the attributes.
