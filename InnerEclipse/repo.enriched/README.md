# Repository Enriched

This is an enriched version of the repository editor. It was enriched to support annotations along with the corresponding transformation.

# Important Development Note

In theory, we rely heavily on org.palladiosimulator.editors.sirius.repository along with org.palladiosimulator.editors.sirius.services.
Keep an eye on changes of these!

# Requirements

Cuurently it looks like you need a proper installation of Eclipse neon.2 with various plugins. Look at [INSTALLATION.md](../INSTALLATION.md) for more info.
