# Sirius Editor for designing concernrepositories
Editor for creating concerns etc within a concernrepository.

## TODO
* Elementary Concern Requirement Edge  and Deployment Constraint Edge manipulation
  * better delete

* Annotation Target: Add Icon in correct size (how?)
* Deployment constraints as list? Maybe then change with doubleclick.
* Label edit better (fail safe) -> done?
* Check copyright on icons (http://www.iconarchive.com/show/busy-icons-by-handdrawngoods/strategy-icon.html and http://www.iconarchive.com/show/mono-business-icons-by-custom-icon-design/target-icon.html)
