 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc --> Set Variable Action Assigns a variable characterisation to an OUT
 * parameter, INOUT parameter, or return value of the service. It ensures that performance-relevant
 * output parameter characterisations of a component service are specified to use them to
 * parameterise the calling RDSEFF. A SetVariableAction must only use output parameters on the left
 * hand side of the assignment and must not use input parameter or local variable names, because
 * input parameters cannot be returned and local names should not be exposed to adhere the black box
 * principle. The action is only intended to allow proper data flow modelling (i.e., output
 * parameter passing) between different component services, but not to reveal additional internals
 * of the service the current RDSEFF models. Thus, the assigned characterisation is not accessible
 * in subsequent actions of the current RDSEFF. Notice, that the stochastic expression used in this
 * assignment must characterise the result of the whole computation of the current service. For
 * non-trivial components, this requires a substantial stochastic approximation based on manual
 * abstraction. However, recall that not the actual result of a component service needs to be
 * specified, but only its performance-relevant attributes. For example, to model the return value
 * of a component service compressing a file, using its file size divided by the compression factor
 * as the stochastic expression is usually sufficient, while the value of the compressed file is not
 * of interest in a performance model. Multiple SetVariableActions assigning to the same output
 * parameter might occur at different locations of the control flow in an RDSEFF. In the case of
 * sequences, loops, and fork, the last assignment overwrites the former assignments and gets
 * transferred back to the calling RDSEFF. Therefore, analysis tools may ignore the former
 * assignments. In the case of using a SetVariableAction in two different branches of a
 * BranchAction, only the assignment in the chosen branch is valid and gets transferred back to the
 * caller. <!-- end-model-doc -->
