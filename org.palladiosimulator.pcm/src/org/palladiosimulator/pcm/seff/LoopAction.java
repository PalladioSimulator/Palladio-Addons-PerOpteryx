 * <!-- begin-user-doc --> A representation of the model object '<em><b>Loop Action</b></em>'. <!--
 * end-user-doc -->
 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc --> Models the repeated execution of its inner ResourceDemandingBehaviour
 * for the loop body. The number of repetitions is specified by a random variable evaluating to
 * integer or an IntPMF. The number of iterations specified by the random variable always needs to
 * be bounded, i.e., the probabilities in an IntPMF for iteration numbers above a certain threshold
 * must be zero. Otherwise, it would be possible that certain requests do not terminate, which would
 * complicate performance analyses. The stochastic expression defining the iteration random variable
 * may include references to input or component parameters to model dependencies between the usage
 * profile and the number of loop iterations. Notice, that loop actions should only be modelled if
 * the loop body contains either external service calls or resource demands directed at special
 * resources. Otherwise, control flow loops in component behaviour should be abstracted by subsuming
 * them in InternalAction, which combine a number of instructions. The influence of different
 * iterations length of such internal loops need to be reflected stochastically by the random
 * variable specifying the ParametricResource-Demand of that InternalAction. Other than Markov
 * chains, RDSEFFs do not specify control flow loops with an reentrance and exit probability on each
 * iteration. Such a specification binds the number of loop iterations to a geometrical
 * distribution, which reflects reality only in very seldom cases. But in many practical cases, the
 * number of iterations is a constant, or the probability for higher iteration numbers is higher
 * than for lower ones. This cannot be expressed directly via a Markov chain (also see [DG00]).
 * Inside the ResourceDemandingBehaviour of LoopActions, it is assumed that random variables are
 * stochastically independent. This is not true in reality, and for example leads to wrong
 * predictions if the same random variable is used twice in succession inside a loop body. In this
 * case, the second occurrence is stochastically dependent to the first occurrence, as the value
 * does not change between two occurrences. Therefore, component developers should be aware of such
 * inaccuracies when using random variables twice inside the body behaviour of a LoopAction. <!--
