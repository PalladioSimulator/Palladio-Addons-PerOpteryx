/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc --> A representation of the model object '<em><b>Sub System</b></em>'. <!--
 * end-user-doc -->
 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc --> A SubSystem is structually comparable to a CompositeComponent. The major
 * difference is the white-blox property it preserves for System Deployers. While Component
 * Developer have a white-box view for their CompositeComponents, a System Deployer perceives a
 * CompositeComponent like any other component as a black-box entity, which thus cannot be allocated
 * onto different nodes in the resource environment (a CompositeComponent cannot be split up at
 * allocation time). Opposed to that, SubSystems are white-box entities for System Deployers,
 * meaning that they can be allocated to different nodes of the resource environment, if required.
 * They are pure logical groupings of components, which can be reused by Component Developers and
 * System Architects like usual components.
 *
 * Remark 1: If a SubSystem is part of a CompositeComponent (inner component) is looses its
 * white-box property, as there is a outer black-box component hiding the its and consequently the
 * SubSytem's internals.
 *
 * Remark 2: Structurally, SubSytem can be converted into CompositeComponents and vice versa.
 *
 * Example: To model a layered architecture, of which each layer is potentially split up to run on
 * multiple machines (in the resource environment), each layer can be represented by a subsystem,
 * allowing to allocated each layer's components individually. <!-- end-model-doc -->
