 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc --> Provided (Component) Types abstract a component to its provided
 * interfaces, leaving its requirements and implementation details open. So, provided types subsume
 * components which offer the same functionality, but with different implementations. As different
 * implementations might require different services from the environment, provided types omit
 * required interfaces. Provided types allow software architects to focus on a componentâ€™s
 * functionality and introduce weak substitutability to the PCM. Using provided types, software
 * architects can draft ideas on how functionality can be partitioned among different components
 * without worrying about their implementation. In the initial phases of architectural design, it
 * often does not make sense to arrange all details of a component, since most of them depend on the
 * actual implementation and thus need to be specified by component developers. As during this phase
 * the actual implementation is unknown, also the required interfaces of a component cannot be
 * stated. However, software architects can still pre-evaluate a software architecture containing
 * provided-types. This gives rough estimates about the quality of the build software system and
 * defines QoS requirements for the component implementation. <!-- end-model-doc -->
