/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc --> A representation of the model object '<em><b>Protocol</b></em>'. <!--
 * end-user-doc -->
 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc --> A protocol is a set of calling sequences and can be optionally added to
 * an interface. Protocols of provided interfaces specify the order in which services have to be
 * called by clients. Protocols of required interfaces specify the actual order in which the
 * component calls required services.
 *
 * Besides finite state machines, different formalisms can be used to model protocols. The PCM does
 * not restrict the protocol modelling formalisms. For example, Petri nets or regular expressions
 * could model interface protocols. However, the choice of a formalism does influence possible
 * analyses. For example, to check the interoperability of two components A and B, the language
 * inclusion of the required protocol of A within the provided protocol of B has to be tested. The
 * language inclusion is undecidable for Petri nets in the general case, so protocols modelled with
 * Petri nets cannot be checked for interoperability. Notice, that although protocols are able to
 * express the state of a component, interfaces themselves are stateless. The protocol state only
 * depends on the component that implements the interface and is only present during component
 * runtime. Components can provide/require multiple interfaces, but the PCM does not support
 * protocols ranging over multiple interfaces (neither for provided nor required protocols). The
 * complete state of a components consists of all its interface states. Restrictions on the complete
 * state cannot be expressed in the PCM, as protocols can only be specified for single interfaces.
