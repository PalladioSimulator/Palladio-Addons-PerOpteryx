ComponentCost specify how much is added to the software architecture cost if the referenced component is used. FixedProcessingResourceCost specify how much is added to the overall cost if the server that contains the referenced ProcessingResourceSpecification (e.g. a CPU with speed 1GHz) is used. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Thus, to determine the overall cost of one candidate solution (i.e. one architecture), we need to check the PCM model to see which components and servers are used. We might want to add more classes to the taskmodel to make this easier. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;See the Cost element for details on the use of this model.
