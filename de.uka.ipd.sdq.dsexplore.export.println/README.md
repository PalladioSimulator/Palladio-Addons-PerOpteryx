This plugin is only an example that shows how to implement the extension point de.uka.ipd.sdq.dsexplore.currentcandidates.

At this extension point after each iteration the current candidates and their predicted quality attributes can be handled, e.g. to export them to different formats.
This extension prints them to the console of an outer Eclipse instance.
