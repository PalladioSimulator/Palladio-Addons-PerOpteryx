This project stuff as Run Configurations to start the "Inner eclipse"
and (maybe later) other useful stuff for a 'newbe' like myself.

- Please use the formatter of this project (and maybe activate the save actions in preferences)
- Use InnerEclipse.launch to open the "InnerEclipse"
- If some project is "red" try Project->Clean and F5
